### Computer-Vision
---


** This repository will hold a series of small projects dealing with the main topics in Deep Learning Computer Vision. 
** Most of the projects are adaptations from the Fast.ai course (Jeremy Howard). 
** Usually I will adapt an existing data set and model from Fast.ai (e.g. adding Pandas and Polar Bears to Bear Classifier) 
** Ideally I will provide my own dataset (as in Running Shoes, Electric Guitars or Racebikes)
