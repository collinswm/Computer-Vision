And with that growth, an industry has sprung up around it providing acoustic guitars of all sorts to the market. Perhaps the biggest factor that determines the value of a guitar is the type of tonewood used for the top and back and side sections.A cheap laminated guitar can be found often under $100 whereas a custom made guitar using Brazilian Rosewood or African Blackwood can fetch 5 and even 6 figures. \n","\n","This model will aim to help guitar players or prospective guitar purchasers to identify the species of wood on any guitar they upload to a simple web app. \n","\n","The idea would be to create two classifiers: \n","1. An app to help identify the tonewood used the the guitar top - which is perhaps the most important determinant of sound quality and tonal richness.\n","\n","2. An app which identifies the guitar back and sides which is creitically important in creating a tonal signature, bass, sustain and resoance. A mahogany guitar had a very different, more imediate sound than a rosewood guitar which rings on for a lot longer."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gXHQfkVffQmT","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Load the Libraries\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ek2oPaS9et4F","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["### Load libraries\n","\n","import os.path\n","from fastai.vision import *\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","%matplotlib inline"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GUJaB9-afGA1","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Here I am mounting the Google Drive using a code snippet from Fastai\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"SE0V-P0Ve5ll","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# ### Mount the Gooogle Drive with source data\n","\n","# from google.colab import drive\n","# drive.mount('/content/gdrive', force_remount=True)\n","# root_dir = \"/content/gdrive/My Drive/\"\n","# base_dir = root_dir + 'fastai-v3/'"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JNgEiXDyeVn5","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Download the sample images from Google Images\n","\n","---\n","\n","Using Google Image Search, I have downloaded a sample of images which conform to the major wood types.
